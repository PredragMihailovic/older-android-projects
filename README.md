Older android projects
=================

Some of the older android projects that I've made couple of years ago

• NewZapp
--------------
App that uses NewsApi and loads news from all around the world.

• PlaceGuess
--------------
Quiz app that uses GooglePlaces and GoogleMaps as core functionality. Images or Street Views are shown to users and they need to place marker on the map where that image/street view is located. Points are acquired based on distance from the correct place.

• ChatBot
--------------
Users can chat with ChatBot that uses TensorFlow as backend.
